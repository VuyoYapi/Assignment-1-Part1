This project is a standalone command-line application developed in C# using Visual Studio. The application allows users to create and manage a single recipe by entering details such as ingredients and preparation steps. The key features of the application include:

Adding a Recipe: Users can input the number of ingredients and steps for a recipe. For each ingredient, the user specifies the name, quantity, and unit of measurement. For each step, the user provides a description of the action.

Displaying a Recipe: The application neatly displays the full recipe, including all ingredients and steps.

Scaling the Recipe: Users can scale the recipe by a factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double), or 3 (triple). The application adjusts the quantities of all ingredients accordingly.

Resetting Quantities: Users can reset all ingredient quantities to their original values after scaling.

Clearing the Recipe: Users have the option to clear all entered data, allowing them to start fresh with a new recipe.

In-Memory Storage: All data is stored in memory, meaning it is not persisted between application runs.

The application is designed following standard coding practices, using classes and methods to ensure modularity and reusability. It uses arrays to store ingredients and steps, and thorough commenting is included to explain the code structure and logic. The project is version-controlled using GitHub, with regular commits to track development progress.
